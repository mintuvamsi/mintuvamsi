Hi, I'm a Data engineer with a passion for building efficient and scalable web applications. I have a strong background in full-stack development, with experience in languages such as Python, and SQL. In my previous roles, I've worked on projects ranging from small startups to large enterprise systems, collaborating with teams of developers to deliver high-quality software.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the tech industry. Some of my current projects include sentimental analysis, EDA and a serverless API for a machine learning model.

Feel free to check out my profile and get in touch if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.
